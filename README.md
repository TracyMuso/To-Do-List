## To-Do-List App

> In this project, I made a simple website called To-do-List. The user is able to add and remove tasjs, mark them as done or undone, the added tasks are arranged in a list at the top of the page, I used different modules with javascript classes to make these functions possible. I used simple html to set up the pages. I am using webpack javascript bundle to make this.
